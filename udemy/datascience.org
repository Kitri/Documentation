** Define terms

*** Analysis

Perform analysis on data that happened in the past. Do analysis to explain how and why something happened

*** Analytics

Explores potential future events
 
 - Qualitative = using intuition + analysis for analytics
 - Quantative = using formulas and algorithms for analytics

*** Business Intelligence

The process of analysing and reporting historical business data

Typical job titles in BI: 
 - BI Analyst [ Performs analyses and reporting of past historical data ]
 - BI Consultant [ "External BI analyst" ]
 - BI Developer [ More advanced analyses specifically designed for the company using tools like SQL and Python ]

Big Data is classified according the 3 V's:
  - Volume [ A LOT of data, more than a human can manage without tools ]
  - Variety [ Audio, Video, Text (structured and unstructured) .. ]
  - Velocity [ Speed of data, e.g. recording stock prices once per second ]

*** AI

Simulating human knowledge and decision making with computers

**** Machine learning

The ability of machines to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed.

ML is about creating and implementing algorithms that let machines receive data and use this data to:
 - make predictions
 - analyse patterns
 - give predictions


** Data science disciplines

Analytics is used in modern days to describe roles that technically do analytics + analysis e.g. business analytics / data analytics
