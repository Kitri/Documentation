** Define terms

*** Analysis

Perform analysis on data that happened in the past. Do analysis to explain how and why something happened

*** Analytics

Explores potential future events
 
 - Qualitative = using intuition + analysis for analytics
 - Quantative = using formulas and algorithms for analytics

*** Business Intelligence

2. extract useful models

*** AI

Simulating human knowledge and decision making with computers

**** Machine learning

The ability of machines to predict outcomes without being explicitly programmed.

ML is about creating and implementing algorithms that let machines receive data and use this data to:
 - make predictions
 - analyse patterns
 - give predictions


** Data science disciplines

Analytics is used in modern days to describe roles that technically do analytics + analysis e.g. business analytics / data analytics
