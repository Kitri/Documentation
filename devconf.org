**  BIO 
   My journey as a Software / BI Developer started in 2012 in the
   world of Object Orientation. I soon started playing around in the
   Business Intelligence space, and found a passion in data. I've
   worked with the SQL BI stack as well as BI using distributed
   processing frameworks with nosql databases.

   In 2019 I joined Jemstep as a software engineer working primarily
   in the functional programming paradigm using Scala.

   I enjoy the challenge of learning new things and do not limit
   myself to a single technology or paradigm of work. The same goes in
   my personal life where I juggle ballroom dancing, boardgames, D&D
   and trying to be outdoors on some rock face away from society as
   often as I can.

   I like VIM, Emacs and potatoes.


**  5 Things the BI, OO and FP worlds could learn from each other, from someone who has lived in all 3

*** Talk Description 
    
    Object Oriented programming, Business Intelligence and Functional programming sound like 3 completely different, unrelated "worlds". Having worked in all three of these worlds I have found 
    similarities and major differences, especially concerning the mindset needed to solve problems in these different realms. The approach to tackling a problem may be completely
    different depending on which world you are working in, however, having knowledge from the other worlds and seeing things from a different perspective may help you in finding a creative solution
    that you would not normally have thought of.

    In this session I want to highlight some things that each of these "worlds" does well and that the other worlds can learn from. I believe I have a unique perspective on things due to having worked 
    in BI and having moved into FP with a data mindset and not only the typical OO mindset. 

*** Notes
    - Art of OO/FP/BI
    - Mindset
    - Approach to solving problems
**** FP: 
     - Stateless
     - Concurrency
     - monads 
       - allows for error bubbling
       - can do set wise operations such as map
     - no loops
     - immutable
     - Design can be elegant (if you understand the complex workings under the hood)
     - Hard to learn

**** OO
     - Object based
     - Work with 1 item at a time
     - Transformation done on a single object at a time
     - Mutable objects
     - Not concurrent safe
     - Design can become spaghetti easily
     - Error handling all over
     - Can miss errors
     - State per object

**** BI
     - Work in sets
     - Transformations on sets
     - Allows for distributed processing
     - Concurrency safe
     - Errors per transaction
     - Idempotent - it's ok to rerun the script
     - Stores state but easy to change


**  5 core skills to help you become a better team lead - from an introvert dev who learnt the hard way 
*** Talk Description
There is a very common pattern in the developer industry to take the most senior technical person on the project and make them a team lead. Often times this person did not previously have to focus on
the people they work with. For many people figuring out how to maximise your team and ensure they're happy and have warm fuzzy team feelings is not an easy task.

In this session I will share my experience having been in that awkward position where I suddenly had to "lead a team" and then had to go through the long, difficult process of learning these "people skills"
that I now needed along with my technical skills. I went on some short management courses at GIBS, did a scrum master course, spoke to many people and read some books. After some failed attempts at
being a team lead I eventually started getting better at it. Just as I got used to and more comfortable with being the team lead, I decided to make a career change and moved back into a technical role.
This was surprisingly challenging as I now had to be a team player again, did not have to pay extreme close attention to all of my team members and have one-on-ones when I sense something is wrong and the 
finally accept and respect the new team lead and not try to take over from them.

Finally I will explain some "core skills" that I have found make a huge difference to you as a leader and your team as individuals as well as the team as a whole. Some of these skills are easy to explain and
may seem quite obvious, but they can be quite tricky to master, or even to be "ok" at. Sometimes just being ok at a skill already makes a big difference in team dynamics.
 
*** Notes
    Firstly, yes, your focus is now on the people and not only the tech.
    - Regular one-on-ones
    - Get to know the people in your team
    - Understand levels of trust
    - Values / ? / Action - always find out what the value was before judging the action
    - Pay attention to the meta conversation
    - Read books: 5 dysfunctions of a team, talking with tech leads
    - Learn to facilitate
    - Team building / activities. Going for coffee as a team can be magic!
    - Maximise your team
      - Find each person's strengths and figure out how to leverage it
      - Also find people's growth areas and help them figure out how to grow in those areas
      - Make sure that their strengths actually aligns with what they want to do - don't force them to do stuff they're good at which they hate!
    - Be approachable
    - Give the option of a 2ic or someone else they can approach in case they aren't comfortable doing it with you, or want to complain about you.

**** As a ex-team lead in a dev team, these are my experiences:
- Was a lead, now I am a dev with a lead
- lead in training and hard for me to step back to let them learn 
- by default tuning in to team members and internally asking questions like "why is that person late for standup? What is the underlying reason?
- Used to "calling the shots", I get to decide when other people take leave, where I also never really had to "ask permission" to take leave. Since I knew when my team was taking leave and where we were at with work I could make the call on whether it was a good time for me to take leave, and then after the decision discuss it with my team. Now I have to first discuss it with my team lead, which adds a different dimension to it
- Used to running around between meetings, one-on-ones, checking in with my account manager about my team - if they need training etc, and when I get to code it's my own choice what I work on and when to do so. I could manage my own time, since I was too busy to commit to pairing 
- Had to start introspecting to determine "what makes a good team member" .. and then try to be that person
- I am now a full-time dev again and finding it challenging to focus on one thing for an extended period of time.
- I held the space for my previous teams, now I need to be part of the team where the space had already been defined and I need to fit into the space
